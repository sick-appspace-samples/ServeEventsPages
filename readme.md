## ServeEventsPages
Serving an event in a script which will be available in the user interface.

### Description
This sample serves an event which is then available though the user interface.
On every timer expiration the event will be notified with the parameter passing
to the user interface and written to the gui. The result can be seen at
the DevicePage. The implementation can be seen in the EventsPages.msdd at the
'ServingEvent' page.  To make the event available it also must be served in the App Properties
(right-click on App -> Properties -> Serves).
